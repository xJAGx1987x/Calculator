# Calculator

5_13_2023 Update:

Noticed an issue within the negation button. Corrected the logic 
within button's action listener and updated Calc.java file within
this repository. 

Subsequently updated README.md within this repository
to reflect those changes. Also, I've created an updated .jar file
(Compiled on Java version 17) to continue testing functionality
of the calculator. 

Initial Upload:

Calculator App. GUI created with Netbeans IDE. 
Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentials,
square roots, and negations. 

I've included a jar executable file(Compiled on java version 17) in 
case you'd like to test the functionality ( or if you have an overwhelming 
desire for a purple calculator on your PC) =]
