# Calculator

Calculator App. GUI created with Netbeans IDE. 
Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentials,
square roots, and negations. 

I may add more to this over time. 

I've included a jar executable file(Compiled on java version 17) in 
case you'd like to test the functionality ( or if you have an overwhelming 
desire for a purple calculator on your PC) =]
